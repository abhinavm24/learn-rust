# Chapter 20.2: Turning Our Single-Threaded Server into a Multithreaded Server

## Key Takeaways

### Thread Pool Implementation
- **Worker Threads**: Pre-created threads that handle requests
- **Job Queue**: Channel-based system for distributing work
- **Resource Management**: Fixed number of threads to prevent resource exhaustion
- **Concurrent Processing**: Handle multiple requests simultaneously

### Thread Pool Architecture
```rust
pub struct ThreadPool {
    workers: Vec<Worker>,
    sender: mpsc::Sender<Job>,
}

struct Worker {
    id: usize,
    thread: thread::JoinHandle<()>,
}

type Job = Box<dyn FnOnce() + Send + 'static>;
```

### Thread Pool Creation
```rust
impl ThreadPool {
    pub fn new(size: usize) -> ThreadPool {
        assert!(size > 0);
        
        let (sender, receiver) = mpsc::channel();
        let receiver = Arc::new(Mutex::new(receiver));
        
        let mut workers = Vec::with_capacity(size);
        
        for id in 0..size {
            workers.push(Worker::new(id, Arc::clone(&receiver)));
        }
        
        ThreadPool { workers, sender }
    }
    
    pub fn execute<F>(&self, f: F)
    where
        F: FnOnce() + Send + 'static,
    {
        let job = Box::new(f);
        self.sender.send(job).unwrap();
    }
}
```

### Worker Implementation
```rust
impl Worker {
    fn new(id: usize, receiver: Arc<Mutex<mpsc::Receiver<Job>>>) -> Worker {
        let thread = thread::spawn(move || loop {
            let job = receiver.lock().unwrap().recv().unwrap();
            println!("Worker {} got a job; executing.", id);
            job();
        });
        
        Worker { id, thread }
    }
}
```

### Key Design Decisions
- **Channel Communication**: Use mpsc for job distribution
- **Shared Receiver**: Arc<Mutex<Receiver>> for worker access
- **Closure Jobs**: Store work as boxed closures
- **Worker Loop**: Continuous polling for new jobs

### Performance Improvements
- **Concurrent Requests**: Multiple requests processed simultaneously
- **Resource Efficiency**: Fixed thread count prevents system overload
- **Responsive Server**: Non-blocking request handling
- **Scalable Architecture**: Easy to tune thread pool size

### Thread Safety Considerations
- **Shared State**: Mutex protection for shared receiver
- **Send Trait**: Ensure closures can be sent between threads
- **'static Lifetime**: Jobs must not reference stack data
- **Arc for Sharing**: Reference counting for multiple ownership

### Integration with Previous Chapters
- Uses concurrency concepts from Chapter 16
- Applies smart pointers from Chapter 15
- Demonstrates closure usage from Chapter 13
- Builds on single-threaded foundation

### Real-World Applications
- Web servers and HTTP handlers
- Background job processing systems
- Parallel computation frameworks
- Producer-consumer architectures
