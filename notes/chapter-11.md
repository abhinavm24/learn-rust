# Chapter 11: Writing Automated Tests

## Key Takeaways

### Testing Fundamentals
- **Purpose**: Verify code correctness and prevent regressions
- **Complement to Type System**: Tests catch logic errors that compiler cannot detect
- **Confidence**: Enable safe refactoring and code changes
- **Documentation**: Tests serve as executable examples of how code should work

### Test Types in Rust
- **Unit Tests**: Test individual functions and methods in isolation
- **Integration Tests**: Test multiple components working together
- **Documentation Tests**: Tests embedded in documentation comments
- **Benchmark Tests**: Measure performance (with nightly Rust)

### Testing Workflow
- Write tests alongside code
- Run tests frequently during development
- Use tests to guide refactoring
- Maintain tests as code evolves

### Core Testing Concepts

#### Test Attributes
```rust
#[test]
fn test_function_name() {
    // test code
}

#[should_panic]
fn test_that_should_fail() {
    // code that should panic
}

#[ignore]
fn expensive_test() {
    // test that takes long time
}
```

#### Assertion Macros
```rust
assert!(boolean_expression);
assert_eq!(left, right);
assert_ne!(left, right);
```

### Basic Test Structure
```rust
#[cfg(test)]
mod tests {
    use super::*;
    
    #[test]
    fn it_works() {
        let result = 2 + 2;
        assert_eq!(result, 4);
    }
    
    #[test]
    fn another_test() {
        assert!(true);
    }
}
```

### Running Tests
```bash
cargo test                    # Run all tests
cargo test test_name         # Run specific test
cargo test --release         # Run tests in release mode
cargo test -- --nocapture    # Show println! output
cargo test -- --ignored      # Run ignored tests
```

### Test Organization Patterns
- **Unit tests**: In same file as code being tested
- **Integration tests**: In `tests/` directory
- **Common test utilities**: In `tests/common/mod.rs`
- **Module tests**: Nested test modules for organization

### Best Practices
- Write descriptive test names
- Test both success and failure cases
- Use `Result<T, E>` in tests for better error messages
- Keep tests simple and focused
- Test edge cases and boundary conditions

### Integration with Previous Chapters
- Tests use all Rust language features
- Error handling with Result in tests
- Generic functions can be tested with multiple types
- Traits enable testable abstractions

### Practical Applications
- Regression testing during refactoring
- API contract verification
- Performance regression detection
- Documentation that stays current
- Continuous integration validation
