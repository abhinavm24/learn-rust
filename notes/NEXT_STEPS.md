# Rust Learning - Next Steps Task List

## High Priority Tasks (Start Here)

### üî• Hands-On Coding Practice
- [ ] **Code Chapter 2 Examples** - Run the guessing game to practice basic Rust syntax
  - Build the complete guessing game from scratch
  - Experiment with different input validation approaches
  - Practice using `match` expressions and `Result` handling

- [ ] **Master Chapter 4 Ownership** - Work through all ownership examples until concepts feel natural
  - Code all ownership transfer examples
  - Practice with move semantics vs copy semantics
  - Understand when values are dropped and why

- [ ] **Build Chapter 12 CLI Tool** - Create the grep-like command line tool for I/O and error handling practice
  - Implement argument parsing and validation
  - Add file reading and text searching functionality
  - Practice proper error handling with `Result` types

## Medium Priority Tasks (Next Steps)

### üìö Note Enhancement
- [ ] **Add 'Common Mistakes' sections** to challenging chapters
  - Chapter 4 (Ownership): Move after use, double free attempts
  - Chapter 10 (Generics/Lifetimes): Lifetime annotation errors
  - Chapter 15 (Smart Pointers): Reference cycles, memory leaks
  - Chapter 16 (Concurrency): Data races, deadlocks

- [ ] **Create Quick Reference Cards** for frequently used syntax patterns
  - Ownership rules and borrowing syntax
  - Pattern matching variants (`match`, `if let`, destructuring)
  - Error handling patterns (`?` operator, `unwrap_or_else`)
  - Iterator methods and closures

### üõ†Ô∏è Practical Application
- [ ] **Start Personal Rust Project** using concepts from multiple chapters
  - Choose project type: CLI tool, web server, or systems utility
  - Apply ownership, error handling, and collections concepts
  - Use proper project structure with modules (Chapter 7)

- [ ] **Review Earlier Chapters** before advancing to advanced topics (Ch 15+)
  - Re-read and code examples from Chapters 1-8
  - Ensure solid understanding before smart pointers and concurrency
  - Update personal notes with any new insights

## Low Priority Tasks (Long-term Goals)

### üöÄ Advanced Enhancement
- [ ] **Add Performance Considerations** to relevant chapters
  - Chapter 8 (Collections): When to use Vec vs HashMap vs BTreeMap
  - Chapter 13 (Iterators): Zero-cost abstractions and lazy evaluation
  - Chapter 16 (Concurrency): Thread overhead vs async alternatives

### üåç Community Engagement
- [ ] **Find Open Source Rust Project** for real-world experience
  - Browse GitHub for beginner-friendly Rust projects
  - Look for issues tagged "good first issue" or "help wanted"
  - Focus on projects that match your interests and skill level

- [ ] **Join Rust Community** for discussion and support
  - Join official Rust Discord server
  - Participate in r/rust subreddit discussions  
  - Attend local Rust meetups or online events
  - Ask questions about concepts from your notes

## Study Strategy Guidelines

### ‚úÖ Recommended Approach
1. **Code First**: Always implement examples before reading ahead
2. **Build Understanding**: Don't just copy code - understand why it works
3. **Practice Regularly**: Consistent daily practice better than weekend marathons
4. **Ask Questions**: Use community resources when stuck
5. **Apply Concepts**: Build small projects to reinforce learning

### üìã Progress Tracking
- [ ] Mark tasks complete as you finish them
- [ ] Add dates when you complete major milestones
- [ ] Note any challenges or insights in personal learning log
- [ ] Update this list with new tasks as they arise

## Quick Assessment Questions

Before moving to advanced topics, can you confidently:
- [ ] Explain ownership, borrowing, and lifetimes?
- [ ] Handle errors properly with `Result` and `Option`?
- [ ] Use pattern matching effectively?
- [ ] Organize code with modules and crates?
- [ ] Work with common collections (Vec, HashMap, String)?

If any are "no", prioritize those chapters for review.
